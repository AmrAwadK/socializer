Automation first approach to building and maintaing personal networks.

---

Socializer is a CLI for automating many integral parts of maintaing a professional network including personalized messages and follow up reminders.

The key features are:

- **Integrate with Google Contacts**: Bring in all your contacts from Google Contacts, and sync any updates there, so you can easily access your contacts at any point on any device.
- **Enrich your contact data**: Use API integrations to fill additional details about your contacts like gender and name details, to enable more message customization.
- **Create personalized messages using templates**: Using a flexible template engine (<a href="https://www.makotemplates.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Mako</a>), leverage your contact details to craft highly personalized messages.
- **Send automated messages**: once you have the personalized messages, you can easily send them to your contacts using Whatsapp, email (WIP), linkedin (WIP), facebook (WIP), and others ...
- **Highly Extensible**: The project is designed with extensibility first using DDD, so you can easily leverage only certain parts of the project or extend it. Check the [road map](roadmap.md) for planned extensions.
